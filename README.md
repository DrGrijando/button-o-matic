button-o-matic
==============

An easy example of a button generator class for Android applications. 

The procedure is the following:

The main activity has some choices for the color of the button and its icon, and allows to add a
caption too. The class also changes the color of the text to white and the font to a custom one, Cabin Medium (which
you can find here: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/cabin).

To apply the colors to the button, a 9-patch image is used (more information here: http://developer.android.com/tools/help/draw9patch.html),
and the font is located in the assets/fonts folder.
